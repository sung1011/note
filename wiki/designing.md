# designing

## USER perceptions are biased by

- `the past` our experience
- `the future` our goals

## DESIGNING perceptions

### avoid ambiguity

Avoid ambiguity information display , and test your design to verify that all users interpret the display in the same way .

### be consistent

Place information and control in consistent locations.

### understand the goals

User come to a system with goalsthey want to achieve.

## GESTALT principle

### Proximity

Relative distance between objects in a display affects our perception of whether and how the objects are organized into sub groups .

- menu

### Similarity

Objects that look similar appear grouped , all other things being equal .

- icon
- form

### Continuity

States that our visual perception is biased to perceive continuous forms rather than disconnected segments .

- half the picture, half the text.

### Closure

State that our visual system automatically tries to close open figures so that they are perceived as whole objects rather than separate pieces .

- icon

### Symmetry

Our vision automatically organizes and interprets the data so as to simplify it and give it symmetry .

- parses very complex two dimensional images info three dimensional scenes .

### Figure / Ground

The foreground consists of those elements of a scene that are the object of our primary attention , and the background is everything else .

- pop up
- icon

### Common Fate

Move together are perceived as grouped or related .

- when users drag folders that they have selected , common highlight and motion make the selected folders appear grouped .

### Structure

The more structured and terse the presentation of information, the more quickly and easily people can scan and comprehend it .

- indent content
- terser repetitious
- improved by table
- separate long numbers .

## Reading Unnatural (disrupt)

### Uncommon or unfamiliar vocabulary

### Difficult scripts and typefaces

- Tiny fonts
- Text on noisy background

### Information buried in repetition

- Centered text
- Reverse Color, Combining flaws that disrupt reading

### Too much text in a user interface

## Color Vision

### How color vision work

#### Trichromacy 三色视觉

posits three types of cones preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. 视网膜的三种视锥细胞分别优先敏感于蓝、绿和红色

#### Opponent process 互补处理

It states that the visual system interprets color in an antagonistic way: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, black vs. white. 视觉系统以一种拮抗的方式解释颜色：红对绿，蓝对黄，黑对白。

### Vision is optimize for contrast, not brightness

The sensitive of our visual system to contrast rather than to absolutely brightness.

### Discriminate colors depends on how colors are presented

- `paleness`

    The paler(less saturated) two color are, the harder it is to tell them apart. such as pale color marking.

- `color patch size`

    The smaller and thinner objects are, the harder it is to distinguish their color. such as chart legend.

- `separation`

    The more separated color patches are, the more difficult it is to distinguish. such as unfollowed link from already followed ones.

### Color blindness

- red/green color-blindness people can't distinguish
  - dark red from black
  - blue from purple
  - light green from white

### External factors that influence the ability to distinguish colors

- variation among color displays
  - computer display vary
- gray-scale display
- display angle
- ambient illusion
  - strong light on a display washes out color

### Guidelines for using color

1. use distinctive colors
2. avoid color pairs that color-blindness cannot distinguish
3. use color redundantly with other cue
   - use symbol icon
4. avoid separate opponent colors
